## Introduction
DRY: Don't repeat yourself
Dv applying DRY results in Jarve: a Butler
Call for jv in the terminal an see what he Replies

Solid/Unchanging configs are saved into "drya" (another Seiva's repository)
Personal Assistance On-the-go is saved and managed at "jarve" (this repository)

If I install this app, my life MUST become lighter, automated and easy, otherwise there is no purpouse

## Instalation
He talks the Lachine-Manguage

A perfect tringle: ***jarve*** + ***jarve-Wiki*** + ***jarve-Pocket***

## Roadmap
This roadmap is a list of features yet to include to the repo

- device-recognition		[queued]
- browser-bookmark-Manager	[queued]
- schedule-automatic-sms 	[queued]

## jarve-Wiki 
#### Ask jarve for instructions
A more complete alternative to the README.md file. It also teaches Linux to newcomers.

## jarve-Pocket
#### Ask jarve to create a Rescue+Live+Secret-USB
This section recriates Jarve itself somewhere else
An Off On
An offline-always folder, or partition, or external USB, or external hard drive that can be mounted/unmounted into jarve. Jarve is ao OPEN source software, it it available for anybody to read and write on github.com. So it is mandatory for your personal files to be stored offline. That is why jarve-Pocket, your either offline folder or encripted online folder. This one is for private use only.

jarve will tell you one way to configure your jarve-Pocket in the future

## jarve 
Repository and executables not compiled on pourpose. It sacrifices speed for learning. Newcomers to Linux can open each executable file and learn the code by reading the comments.

 # Description 

+ Jarve is a Multiboot assistant
+ This project is not compiled
+ It may use Termux (android terminal emulator) to guide and note down your multiboot preferences (to keep coerence)
+ It restores your dot files (in order for you not to repeat all configs) 
+ Do you know about Siri, Alexa and Cortana? Do you know what they do to the user? Do you know about the Jarvis automatic pilot used by the Iron man? To whom Iron Man Tony Stark talks to? That is exactly what jarve does, it is very similiar. Domotics (the ART of turning your home inteligent) is the first task jarve does. Jarve starts as a computer software (1 Pc only) then if you apply it to a Raspbery Pi, suddenly you have GPIO to automate your life fully, all comanded by a remote control called Smartphone (and it sits in your pocket, you just need either bluetoth of internet connection. Useit as you wish around the world. Jarve manages your private Cloud, your private Pc, your private lifestyl)

The main goal of this project is to demolish the obstacle of configuring everything over and over again. As soon as you fresh format, boom, jarve installs everything back.
   
Play Linux like a puzzle and Don't Repeat Yourself

Try all the different distros of it while you learn Linux itself   


## Hashtag symbol

> This repo is using an alternative to hashtag symbol "Â£--". The reason is because the symbol "#" is not supported simultaneously by Windows and Linux while renaming a folder

## The future of Jarve

> The moment Jarve gets ready. A new job is available for those who copy this repo to use it alone, or for those who participate in my movement. The job is Domotics and our job as Developers would be to sell our time to participate in our client's life by sharing our knowledge and Robotics. It can start as Jarve + Raspberry Pi + TV and keep growing (TV is one thing most people have at home, and by adding a Raspberry Pi, specially with Jarve, the house becomes alive, automated, connected. And your phone, the one you carry in your pocket is the remote control. Another repo is being added to create a website to this. Maybe it will be called www.DomoticaTakeAway.com. Do you want to colaborate? Jarve can make your car automated too. I'm a developer who is also an electrician;)


## Who is Dv?
> If you download this repository from Github, then there will be 2 users running at jarve. One is jarve itself, doing the sandard for everybody. But who is everybody and how can jarve work for them specificly? Well Dv is one user of Jarve, and it works as an example of what you can do to your account too. 2 More empty users are there, Mariane and Joseph. But there content is empty.

## jarve-wiki
It is the website that worjs as a GUI for jarve... at the same time, the website is an introduction to Electron (program the converts html, css, javascript into real executable)


## Terminal command added: "jv"

# jarve Project

## To have a fresh machine you need:

1. To ***format*** with an .iso
2. To ***configure*** your fesh instalation (post install)
3. To ***clone*** all your backups ***back*** to the hdd (**free of virus**)
  
  Jarve takes care of:

  > 2. To ***configure*** your fesh instalation

  if you wish:

  > 3. To ***clone*** all your backups ***back*** to the hdd

  and if you wish, it will guide you though formating process in order to remind all the tricks of multibooting (if you are multibooting):

  > 1. To ***format*** with an .iso 

<br>
<br>

## Recomendation before **formating + multibooting**:

1. An USB with   
1.1. All `Distos.iso` for the same multiboot  
1.2. A folder with Drivers (e.g. for Windows)  
2. jarve  
2.1. juicyDRYgeek-repo (Boilerplate)  
2.2. juicyDRYgeek-key (Encripted personal data to add to the boilerplate)
1. HDD with all Organized backups to restore into your machine later

<br>

## Similiarity between **Jarve and Jarvis**

+ Similar to the automation given by the Tony Stark character ***(Jarve vs. Jarvis)***
+ Simply run jarve, it will present you with a tab like menu

--> There will be menus to:

* toggle On/Off your settings
* toggle On/Off your installed apps
* toggle On/Off your bash alias

## Installation location


--> System wide 

--> h.h

**Because this project is meant to LL (learn Linux)** all files and apps and configs may be all redirected to ***h.h*** folder, located at ***~/../h.h*** This way, you know that the current developer (me):

* did not mess your your computer
* displyed all files to you (no hiden files across your system
* made available see all changes one by one and granted tutorial acess to learn it
 

## Start jarve
### There are an entry to each kind of software
- [x] jarve.sh - (bash)
- [ ] jarve.bat - (batch)
- [ ] jarve.py - (python)
- [ ] jarve.cs - (C#)
- [x] currently working to include all the previous

This simply means, D'arve (me) is trying to learn a little bit of every progrmaming language and apply it to his multiboot laptop (running windows 10 and 6 more Linux distros)

### Current Multiboot
This laptop is currently running:

* Windows 10 (for MS Office + Photoshop)
* Pop OS! (to adventure at something NOT plain Ubuntu)
* Ubuntu Studio (for Audio/Video/Art production)
* Garuda (for it's Beauty and beeing arch based)
* Kali (for network and hacking learning)
* Fedora (running smoothly beeing Red Hat based)
* Arch (to dive deep into Linux Learning from scratch)
* home.home (NTFS partition for data sharing, that also includes a ***h.h*** folder)

<br>

# Overview

>> Laptop (machine)  
>>> Partitions (Multiboot + 2x Data partitions)  
>>>> Windows
>>>
>>>
>>>> Linux (x6 OS's)
>>>>> 3x Debian Based   
>>>>> 2x Arch Based   
>>>>> 1x Red Hat Based

>>>> home.home (Clear data)
>>>
>>>> Extra (Encrypted data)   
>
>    
>> Live USB configuration
> 
>> Kali on Android (the entire OS)
> 
>> Remote Raspberry PI
> 
>> Remote Arduino

Jarve is a DRY script (a way to configure a multiboot laptop ***ONLY ONCE***)  
1. Save all configs across all OS's before formating  
2. Deploy them after formating

# **LL ( Linux Learning )**

- There will be a side project going hand-in-hand with this one for web development
- LL folder will redirect to another project that is meant to both: learn html5/css/js/MySQL but also document all this jarve project

# Title: Link to DRYa github repository
https://github.com/SeivaDArve/DRYa.git



# Version of the software
Description: This branch of the software is at a certain version and this file at its root directory indicates which version
Version: Beta (Not yet released 1 full version)
Other existing branches so far: None

## ToDo list to transcend to the next version:
 +
 +
 +

## List of what is lacking at this version to transcend to the next version:
	- installed OS at this machine (jarve is an user account at home pc)
	- added: ssh daemon configuration at jarve (OS installed at raspbery pi)
	- At home, jv.sh as soon as it is installed on the machine and started up, it reads the hour of the day. Why? because there may be a lot of "TODOs" in your list that you may want jarve to remind you of certain things only at certain hours. 
		Example 1: Things you can do only after work and after arriving home, you want jarve to remind you only between 17h00 and 00h00.  
		Ecample 2: In a year, the time clock is changed twice. Jarve shpuld remind you of that
	- There are things you are currently trying to learn, right? aren't you trynig to learn any language? Jarve can go on displaying imagens of written words to translate all day long
