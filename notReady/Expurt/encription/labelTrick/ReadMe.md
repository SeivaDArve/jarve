In order JUST to mess up finding results (Ctrl+F or GREP), labelTrick is just to misplace the names od files. No file should have their original names

## 2 Lists:

+ List of original file names (created first)
+ List of Fake names to be replaced by original names
+ Use 'tr' command from Linux shell to re-map characters and hide tje original name.... Later, when you wn
ant the original name, just use 'tr' to undo the name. (Tutorial here: https://youtu.be/_0IFtMFYroU)
