jarvEncription

is a tool used by the user, but sugested by jarve

Do you want to hide something?
sugestion:
1. Zip de folder with all files you want
2. Use some encription
3. Use HJsplit (a software to divide 1 file into 7)
4. Cut each part into 7 dufferent USB sticks (you may use a Hub)
5. Geo diferentiate the location of all 7 UBS sticks

To decript:
1. Plug all UBS stick into a Hub
2. Make jarve detect them automatically
3. Acording to how many USBs are there, the level of safety increases
4. Tell jarve to decript

Sugestion about levels of security:
1. Some files may be split into 2
2. Some files may be split into 3
3. Some files may split into 7
4. Tell jarve to decript even if you can find only 4USB sticks.... the number of UBSs describe the levelnof security
