In this folder there will be a script to use when you want something to be done at a foreign laptop. 

it backs-up the current friend's machine slias and replaces with your own temporarily

no need to undo. It may be automatic

This script is used when you use your friends laptop as a guest

It delets all this repo except this folder (maybe this script is better at key-juicyDRYgeek)
