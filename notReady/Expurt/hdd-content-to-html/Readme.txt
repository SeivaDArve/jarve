# Title: HDD content to HTML
# Description: Is there any kind of content in your hdd worth listing? Are you keeping "taloes", "faturas", "recibos" of something important every month? Do you want to list things properly and navigate your hard drive properly? I think you should use your HDD as a website
# Use: Create an index.html at you External Hard Drive Disk and navigate your contents properly
