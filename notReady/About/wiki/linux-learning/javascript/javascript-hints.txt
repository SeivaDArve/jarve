In javascript, you can use only the console of your browser to navigate throw the web pages.

Here are some curiosities on how to do a few things:

//from you current webpage, navigate to any other webpage according to URL (if you know to URL by memory):
window.location.href = 'http://www.youtube.com'

//This is to press the "Go Back" button of your browser
window.history.go(-1)

//This is to create a simple alert at your browser
alert('fgfgfvgbvmh')

//Ctrl+Shift+k opens the console for javascript directly at firefox
