Folder dedicated to geeks who involve their caur into this business;)

Actually I (dv) am not a software developer, I am an electricial learning Linux.
So, how much is put in this one project is +/- what I know about Linux so far.
My plan is to put jarve working properly to my multiboot laptops and then starting all others projects that I've started
I plan to code jarve and then skip to install an Arduino into a car. (Now with Linux I am planning to install a raspberry pi)
If you want to contribute and make use of Arduino into your veicle, I would like to help;) but we should not skip steps and jarve is now beeing born.
Jarve should be coded first and then we could had extra functionality like controlling your car entirely with your raspberry pi and your Termux (Android).
