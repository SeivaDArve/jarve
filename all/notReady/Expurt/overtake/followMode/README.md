# followMode
Belonging to the category of Expurt, followmode is a bash script that takes a small snapshot of your current tree of directories and files, either with the command ***ls*** or with the command ***tree*** and compares this list with another list. Two snapshots are taken, one is taken before installing a nee software and another after installing that software. 

This is helpfull to know EXACTLY what happens in you machine, nothing should move under the radar, and this is helpfull to learn linux.

This mode is put under Overtake, because when you are using jarve at another forein pc, the owner of that pc (not you) may want to know if you did not plan any bug or trojan into their pc. 

This script should be very good documented and the code should be commented in order to anybody understand it faster without having to learn too much of programming.
