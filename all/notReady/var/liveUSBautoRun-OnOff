jarve will display an app icon at the apps menu, but that is if it is already installed

In case you are using jarve portable (for persistent USBs) then you could give a variable telling ALWAYS that, by clicking jarve, jarve would look for a var to see if it definitly is a Live USB or not. If it is, it would run a few more commands without asking, setting up everything right.

this is the first .sh to run, so it can be humble, not touching much, or it can see clearly that you NEED kali OS to config itself again tottaly - I am calling this the kali effect (or the 'var' created because of kaliUSB)

List in this file, all keyCodes you want to imediatly run
