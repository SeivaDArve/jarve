# termux-OfflineMultiboot-guide

jarve is planned to be a program which guides you through formating (and multibooting). But the plan is not teaching how to multiboot, the plan is to keep a record of all your steps (told by yourself) in order to compile a key (juicyDRYgeek-key, encripted) in order for you to keep track of every single change done by you.

This is usefull not only to remember all changes done, but also to keep the coerence.   
Example of coerence to be maintained:

* When you tell each OS that your PC name is different, and account name is also diferent
