Even with Pop-Up blocker, websites contain javascript that block your screen and make you agree with something

to avoit that:
1. Right click > Inspect
2. Delete properties that are blocking your view

Scrolling is disabled? 
3. Go to the console and type: document.body.style.overflow = "auto"

Happy scolling;)
