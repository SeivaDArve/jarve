You can run several commands to tel you the current status of your machine

just like:
$ free -h	-	-	-	-	-	-	(free memory)
$ vmstat	-	-	-	-	-	-	(CPU)
$ upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0	(battery)
$ sar (not working on fedora)	-	-	-	-	(CPU usage)

and you can also see them live by the command 'watch' like:
$ watch -n 1 "free -h; echo; echo; vmstat; echo; echo; upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0"

view all information about your memory:
$ cat /proc/meminfo
