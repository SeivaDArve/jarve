when you are operating in some random OS
somethimes you need to use some GUI apps.
For example you are using POP OS and it does not have 
Libre office installed. then, if you donÂ´t want to use it right away without instaling
then you need to search other OS's list of apps if any other OS has Libre office installed

Lets say fedora has Libre office installed. Then
you Djarves must find where Libre is installed, and memorize all windows that you have currently open
with the name of the file that you are currently working with

List of tasks for this script:
- Find instaled apps on other partitions (even if they are not mounted)
- see what progrmas are running right now in your current OS
- see what are the files open in your current OS
- see what youtube links (or browser links) are open right now
- say when the list of memories are ready (so you can reboot)
- after rebooting, Djarves comes up with all the apps open previously + web links open + the apps that you where ooking for
- Djarves has to make sure the only time you spend, is the time of rebooting, everything else must open automatic.
-include bookmarks (if any bookmark is new, replace the old for the new)
