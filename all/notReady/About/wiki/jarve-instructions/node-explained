This file explains the "Node"

--> Node is that this that has everything but is not in anyway heavy
--> If you have acesse to Github.com/juicyDRYgeek-repo than you have everything everywhere (the node)
--> Keep your focus on what the node is doing
--> the node (the repo) as it all (installers + uninstallers + content)
--> the node only offers (it is a folder to send)
--> h.h folder only receives (it is a folder to receive)
--> Termux is the remote control (to keep up with all activity)

--> the node is placed either at Github.com or home.home (home.home is local node)

Process:
1- Locate Github repo
2- send it to home.home and Termux
	2.1- At Termux you record all future changes everywhere
	2.2- At home.home each step is recorded at h.h
3- from home.home, files will be deployed at ~/../h.h

--> (home.home is usually a DATA partition formated at NTFS)
	--> Windows partition + Linux partition + Data partition (home.home)
	--< (h.h at Windows) + (h.h at Linux) + (Repo at home.home)
