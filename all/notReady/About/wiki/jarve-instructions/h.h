If you run the uninstallers, you SHOULD have your machine as default
If if run all uninstallers and still your making is not exactly and post-format frsh OS, then it is a bug. Because this juicyDRYgeek-repo is a project made specifically to LEARN the in's and out's of the entire Linux system (until absolute mastery and perfection)
